# Slides

A template repository for slides based on [reveal.js](reveal.js).

# How to run (locally)

Serve the static files, using [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) for example.

You also need to have the `reveal.js` submodule initialized. I don't know much about submodules, but this command works for me: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
